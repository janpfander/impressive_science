This exoskeleton provides support and protection for the insect's body and serves as an attachment point for muscles, allowing for efficient movement.

Myrmecologists have sampled and analyzed these pheromones, understanding their exact chemical structure, how they are generated by the ants, and how they are perceived. They have shown for instance that, in the Pharaoh\u2019s ants, how long a pheromone trail lasts depends on how many thousands of ants have walked the trail, and that some ants are much better than others at picking up the trail, suggesting specialization.<\/span><\/p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f79deb72-7fff-272f-7772-603d5c120948\">Myrmecologists have also been able to make sense of some apparently weird behaviors in ants. For instance, in one species, sometimes the workers mostly let female reproductive offspring survive, and sometimes mostly the males. Using mathematical models of evolution, the researchers have been able to show that the worker ants from the same colony should mostly let female reproductive offsprings live when the queen has only mated with one male. They then observed that this is exactly what the ants were doing, and that the worker ants were able to figure out whether they all had the same father or not by smelling each other.<\/span><\/p>","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"ants_imp_text","QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Myrmecologists are the scientists who study ants.
