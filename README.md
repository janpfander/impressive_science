# Trusting but forgetting impressive science

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Abstract

Cultural beliefs and practices often spread because they appeal to
existing cognitive mechanisms. Science, however, appears to be an
exception. Scientific concepts are highly counterintuitive, and people
know very little about science, yet it is among the most trusted
institutions. Here, we test a cognitive model of trust in science that
is compatible with these observations: the rational impression account.
According to this account, people trust scientists because they are
impressed by their findings, and this impression persists after specific
knowledge has vanished. We present evidence for this model in two
experiments (total n = 696) with UK participants. In Experiment 1,
exposure to more impressive scientific findings led participants to
think of the relevant scientists as more competent and their scientific
discipline as more trustworthy. In Experiment 2, we show that
participants have these impressions despite almost immediately
forgetting relevant content.

## How to download and replicate

To reproduce the findings and re-run the analysis, do the following:

1.  Download and install this repository. You can use GitHub to clone or
    fork the repository (see the green “Clone or download” button at the
    top of the GitHub page).
2.  Open `impressive_science.Rproj` to open an [RStudio
    Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3.  Within the RStudio Project, open the `manuscript.Rmd` file and run
    it.

Please find the [session info below](#session-info).

*Estimated installation time* : If you have R and Rstudio installed,
then adding additional packages required in our R scripts is quick (a
couple of minutes)

*Estimated run time*: Rendering the `manuscript.Rmd` document takes less
than 1min on our machine (see [session info](#session-info))

## Files glossary

- `manuscript.Rmd` is the reproducible source script of the paper
- all files with the prefix `manuscript_*` are output files that are
  generated by this source file
- `appendix*` files contain the appendices that are automatically
  rendered when running `manuscript.Rmd`
- `experiment_*` folders contain all files related to the respective
  experiment. The `/data` folders contain the raw data (`qualtrics.csv`)
  and cleaned data (`cleaned.csv`). The cleaning can be reproduced by
  running the `cleaning.Rmd` files in the folder of each respective
  experiment.
- `functions/` folder contains functions that we rely upon in our
  analysis scripts. To keep the `manuscript.Rmd` document neat and
  readable, we wrote all lengthy code bits as external functions.
- running the `manuscript.Rmd` file will generate an `output` folder
  which lists all figures as `.png` and `.pdf` files.
- `references.bib` contains the references
- `gss_cross` contains the cleaning script we used for the cumulative
  GSS cross-section file ([which can be found
  here](https://gss.norc.org/us/en/gss/get-the-data/stata.html))
