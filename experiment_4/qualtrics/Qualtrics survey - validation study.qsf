are scientists who study human history and prehistory. Just by looking at the bones of our ancestors, they can tell whether that person was male or female and how old they were. Moreover, just by looking at the teeth composition, they can also tell when that person stopped drinking their mother's milk."},"2":{"1":"7","2":"Archaeologists are scientists who study history and have the knowledge and skills to tell a multitude of different things by analyzing the bones from the past. These can include the gender of someone and what diseases they suffered from. The most surprising I find is the fact that they can tell what age a baby stopped drinking their mother's breast, even from thousands of years ago, by analyzing their remaining teeth. They are also able to analyze the languages that prehistoric humans may have spoken by looking at their nerves. The increased control humans need of breathing while speaking, for example, made this nerve larger compared to apes. Neanderthals are thought to be right-handed due to examination of the tools they used in the past."},"3":{"1":"8","2":"Archaeologists can discern a great deal of information from studying bones. They can determine things like sex, age, and even when the individual stopped drinking their mother's milk just by the composition of their teeth. It is also possible to learn things about the history of the development of human language. For example, the air canal within the human body is larger than in other animals, perhaps because this is required for the production of speech. This canal is also larger in Neanderthals. Lastly, archaeologists can also determine the handedness of individuals based on the tools they created and believe that handedness is also linked to language."},"4":{"1":"12","2":"Archaeologists can look at bones and determine many things, such as gender and age. They can also tell things from teeth, such as when breast milk was stopped, as it affects the composition of the teeth. They can also determine facts about language\u2014they\u2019ve found there\u2019s a nerve that is bigger in humans, due to them using it to speak. However, Neanderthals also have a larger space (similarly to humans) for this nerve when compared to monkeys\u2014this indicates Neanderthals could speak similarly to humans. They\u2019ve also determined many Neanderthals were right-handed, supporting their hypothesis of speech."},"5":{"1":"14","2":"Scientists who have studied human history are now able to tell us further information from deceased people's bones from thousands of years ago. This includes how long they drank their mother's breast milk, their sex, ages, and if they had any illnesses. They can also tell you if someone was right-handed or left-handed. They can tell what language someone spoke; they do this by looking at a certain bone. It was smaller in Alps than in humans, so that also can distinguish if they were human or an Alp."},"6":{"1":"29","2":"I read how the archaeologists are able to determine gender from the bones, when they stopped taking their mother's milk through the teeth and calcium test. I also read how, due to humans needing to be able to breathe when talking, we require a larger nerve than apes, for example, do."},"7":{"1":"34","2":"They can tell from bones if someone was male or female and if they suffered from a range of diseases. They can tell what age they were when they died, how long ago they died, and if they drank their mother's milk based on their teeth. They can also analyze tools that they made, that most of them were right-handed."},"8":{"1":"37","2":"Ancient bones tell us a lot about people who lived long ago. Scientists can tell if someone was male or female, how old they were when they died, and what diseases they had. By looking at teeth, they can even tell when a person stopped drinking their mother's milk. Scientists study how ancient humans might have spoken. They found that humans have a bigger nerve for breathing control than apes do. This nerve helps us control our breath when we speak. Neanderthals had this bigger nerve too. By studying the tools Neanderthals made, scientists found that most of them used their right hand. Being right-handed is linked to how we speak. This, along with their bigger breathing nerve, suggests Neanderthals could probably talk in some way."},"9":{"1":"38","2":"The text was on what archaeologists can determine based on the bones of people who have been dead for tens of thousands of years. The makeup of a person's teeth can tell archaeologists when they stopped drinking their mother's milk. The bones can tell them if the person was male or female. They can tell you if a person was right-handed or not. They can also show if a person was able to speak due to the size of a cavity for a certain nerve in the body."},"10":{"1":"44","2":"Archaeologists study human history and are able to tell a lot from human bones. This includes things like age, gender, and if they had any diseases. They can also tell when someone died and what age they were when they stopped drinking mother's milk. They can tell this from the teeth. They can also tell if someone is left or right-handed. The canal that has the nerve that controls breathing is bigger in humans than it is in apes."},"11":{"1":"45","2":"Archaeologists can determine gender from bones, at what age they stopped drinking mother's milk from the composition of teeth, and when they died. Humans have larger breath cavities enabling the talk\/breathing. They can tell if some apes are left\/right-handed."},"12":{"1":"54","2":"Archaeologists have recently made some discoveries. From old bones, they can tell if a person was male or female depending on the bone composition. They are also able to tell at what age someone was drinking their mother's milk due to the composition of the teeth they find in the remains. It has also given some insight into the nerves compared to humans today. For example, the nerve in humans for breathing is larger compared to remains found. They believe this is due to the need for finer control of breath for speech. This has also been compared to apes and Neanderthals as they did not have the same capacity for speech."},"13":{"1":"56","2":"Archaeologists can find out when someone stopped having their mother\u2019s milk through the teeth. They can also tell what diseases people had, that they were right-handed from the tools they made, which is also an indicator of language. Part of the throat was larger in Neanderthals and humans."},"14":{"1":"62","2":"It has been found that archaeologists can now tell more about how Neanderthals lived; they can tell from their teeth when they stopped drinking their mother's milk. They have also found that the nerve for controlling breathing is larger in Neanderthals. They also discovered that most Neanderthals were right-handed, and that can help to figure out how their language developed."},"15":{"1":"63","2":"Archaeologists uncover details of the past by studying bones and teeth, revealing age, diseases, and breastfeeding habits. Evidence like larger breathing nerve canals in Neanderthals suggests they had speech capabilities. Tool analysis shows most were right-handed, linking handedness to language evolution and supporting the idea that Neanderthals likely had a form of language."},"16":{"1":"65","2":"Archaeologists have discovered through various records differences between apes, humans, and Neanderthals. They have found that humans and Neanderthals have a larger nerve center for breathing. It is thought that this has helped contribute to the use of language. They have also discovered that Neanderthals were primarily right-handed and have determined that \"handedness\" is a contributor to communication. They have also been able to identify through dental records data points such as when an ancient human stopped drinking their mother's milk. Archaeology will continue to evolve and grow in order to make further historical scientific breakthroughs."},"17":{"1":"67","2":"Archaeologists can determine many factors about our long-dead human ancestors through studying their remains. For example, archaeologists can analyze bones to determine the age, sex, and general health of their owners. They can even determine at what age these ancestors stopped drinking milk from their mothers based on their teeth. Archaeologists have studied Neanderthal remains to try to understand how capable they were of speech and language. It is thought, based on the tools discovered and studied by archaeologists, that Neanderthals were right-handed."},"18":{"1":"69","2":"Archaeologists, who study human and prehuman history, can tell from a skeleton whether the deceased was male or female. They can determine at what age they died and if they suffered any conditions. This applies to skeletons that can be tens of thousands of years old. They can even determine at what age a human stopped drinking their mother's milk, based on the formation of their teeth. There is an air pipe present in both human and ape fossils, but the pipe is larger in humans, most likely due to our need to control our breathing more closely in order to speak. The pipe is also larger in Neanderthals. The majority of Neanderthals were right-handed. Handedness is considered to be connected to language, which indicates that Neanderthals did have some form of language system."},"19":{"1":"76","2":"Archaeologists can now study long-dead human remains to find out when they stopped feeding from their mother's milk from their teeth, if they were male or female, and what diseases they had. Neanderthals were studied and found to be predominantly right-handed for linguistic reasons, which is what it is linked to. The nerve in both Homo sapiens and Neanderthals that controls breathing is enlarged compared to primates, as they use this to help with speech, whereas primates don't."},"20":{"1":"82","2":"Archaeologists are scientists who specialize in human history. They're able to tell genders, age, and diseases from just the bones. Through analysis, they have said that Neanderthals were mostly right-handed, and this links to evidence that they had their own language."},"21":{"1":"86","2":"Scientists can now determine from long-dead bones whether the person was male or female - they can tell from teeth when someone stopped taking their mother's milk. They have also determined from skeletal information whether the person was left- or right-handed. It has also been determined that handedness has had a great influence on the development of language. It has additionally been found that Neanderthals had some form of language skills."},"22":{"1":"87","2":"Archaeologists are able to tell a huge amount about prehistoric people by examining their bones. The sorts of things they can tell are age at death, sex, and even when they stopped breastfeeding by looking at their teeth. The tools found indicate that most of these people were right-handed. Comparing the size of nerve ducting within the bones with apes suggests that larger ducts are related to the ability to speak, maybe due to the additional breathing control required for speech.

For example, the nerve controlling breathing in humans is more sensitive compared to that of apes, likely due to the increased sensitivity of breath required for talking. The canal surrounding the nerve is enlarged in humans as a result. This nerve is also larger in Neanderthals, suggesting that they may have been able to communicate via talking. Archaeologists have also been able to determine that the majority of Neanderthals were right-handed, which is a trait that is thought to be influenced by linguistics - providing further evidence that Neanderthals had language and could communicate through talking."},"32":{"1":"128","2":"Archaeologists are scientists that specialize in human history and prehistory.

They can even look at their teeth and determine when the individual stopped drinking their mom's milk. Archaeologists do more than mess with bones, though; in some instances, they can even determine what sort of language existed at the time. They do this by looking at nerves related to breathing. Humans and Neanderthals developed larger nerves, which gave us the ability to speak and eventually develop a language, compared to apes who, to this day, haven't developed the nerves used to control breathing required to produce consistent speech.

They can also establish a cause of death from the bones provided. They can also show that if a person breathed deeper than other examples of humans, then they might be able to master speech and even create a language with which to communicate.

Astoundingly, the chemical composition of teeth indicates when someone who may have lived tens of thousands of years ago stopped drinking their mother's milk. Archaeologists study all aspects of how our ancestors might have communicated. For example, the nerve controlling respiration is larger in humans than in apes, presumably because fine control over breathing is needed for speaking. This feature is shared in Neanderthals, so they might also have had some form of speech. Tools also provide evidence of behavior. Neanderthal tools indicate that most Neanderthals were right-handed.

They also investigate the potential language abilities of our ancestors and relatives. For example, humans have a larger nerve controlling breathing compared to apes, likely to enable the precise control needed for speech. This feature is reflected in the larger nerve canal found in both humans and Neanderthals. Additionally, by examining tools made by Neanderthals, archaeologists have determined that most were right-handed. Since handedness is thought to be connected to the development of language, this serves as further evidence that Neanderthals likely had a form of language."},"42":{"1":"150","2":"The study of archaeology and the associated fields of anthropology and paleontology provides valuable insights into the lives of our ancient ancestors, including the Neanderthals. Through the analysis of physical remains, including bones and teeth, scientists can glean information about an individual's sex, age at death, and even details about their health. For example, the dental structure can indicate when a child transitioned from nursing to consuming solid foods, which is critical for understanding childhood development in prehistoric populations. Furthermore, the examination of anatomical features, such as the size of the nerve controlling respiration, suggests that the capacity for speech and complex communication may not be exclusive to modern humans. The fact that Neanderthals had a similar enlargement in this nerve canal points toward the possibility that they had a level of vocal control and, consequently, some form of language. Tool analysis further supports this view, indicating that Neanderthals exhibited a preference for right-handedness when crafting their tools. This behavioral trait is often linked to lateralization in the brain, which is associated with language and cognitive processes. The correlation between handedness, tool use, and the potential for language implies that the cognitive capabilities of Neanderthals might have been more advanced than previously thought. Overall, these findings collectively enhance our understanding of the cognitive and communicative abilities of Neanderthals and suggest a richer and more complex social structure than earlier models proposed.

After recent studies comparing the remains of humans, Neanderthals, and apes, there is evidence that the development of speech caused the growth of several breathing and nerve canals directly related to speech. These growths were not present in apes and enlarged to a smaller degree in Neanderthals, which has led to speculation that Neanderthals had a primitive language.

It was seen that these are super sensitive."},"37":{"1":"152","2":"Entomologists have dedicated their careers to studying insects and how insects experience the world we live in. A type of fly, for example, can see at a fraction of the speed we do; some can detect an image shown for only 3 thousandths of a second, which is a tenth of the time a standard movie frame is shown at 24 frames per second. Other facets are recorded by electron microscopes and electrodes that can detect changes in the fly's brain. They have also used a laser-Doppler where they could move the air at an incredibly small strength on the hairs on the rear of a grasshopper's legs and have the grasshopper react. This would make the hairs the most sensitive organ in the animal kingdom."},"38":{"1":"156","2":"Entomologists, who study insects, are making some remarkable discoveries in their research of the insect kingdom. For instance, they have discovered that flies can see images within a very short period of time, unlike anything else known to man, and that crickets possess the most sensitive of tiny hair follicles in reacting to motion. All this has been achieved through the use of advanced technology."},"39":{"1":"163","2":"Entomologists study insects in their area of science. There are specialized entomologists who have uncovered further understanding regarding insects' perception of the world around them and have been able to reveal remarkable abilities. Entomologists have been studying how flies' visual perception works and have used specialized displays to show images for less than the blink of a human eye, utilizing electrodes to record how individual cells in the flies' brains might react, as well as ultra-precise electron microscopy to inspect their eyes. Thanks to this research, scientists have shown some flies and insects can perceive images that have been displayed for only three milliseconds\u2014which is a mere thousandth of a second, easily understood as ten times shorter than a typical movie frame, coming in at 24 frames a second. Entomologists studying specifically the hairs on crickets have shown microscopic hairs, which are found on antenna-like organs on the cricket's backside, are the most sensitive organ in the insect kingdom. The scientists used precision techniques to measure how these hairs reacted to stimuli too, using stimuli like laser-Doppler velocimetry, which is a technique capable of detecting the smallest of movements\/twitches. Using this showed the researchers that the cricket's hairs reacted to changes in the motion of the air that used less physically charged energy than one particle of light, so less than even a single photon."},"40":{"1":"166","2":"Experts in the study of insects, entomologists have discovered incredible abilities in these little creatures by employing state-of-the-art research methods. According to studies, flies, for instance, can process visuals in as little as three milliseconds, which is around ten times faster than the flicker of a single movie frame. Researchers found this incredible achievement using sophisticated brain activity sensors and high-speed displays. Another remarkable discovery by scientists is that the tiny hairs on a cricket's rear antennae are so sensitive that they can detect air movements with an energy level equivalent to one photon. These findings demonstrate not just the extraordinary senses of insects but also the meticulous techniques and inventiveness that underpin current entomological research."},"41":{"1":"170","2":"It shows that entomologists interested in how flies' visual perception works have used special displays to present images in the blink of an eye.

With flies, scientists have been able to study flies' eyes closely and have found that their eyes open and close and take frames extremely quickly, allowing them fast vision. When it came to crickets, they could see their hairs closely and study that they are extremely sensitive, the most sensitive in the animal kingdom, detecting movement easily."},"44":{"1":"174","2":"Entomologists study the life and behavior of insects. They are now trying to understand how they visualize and react to the world they inhabit. One study on their vision showed that they could detect an image that was only visible for 3 milliseconds.

The hair in the rear of the cricket could detect the equivalent of one single photon of light."},"45":{"1":"176","2":"Entomology is the study of insects. Some entomologists have studied how insects perceive the world around them.

The results show that flies can perceive images that are displayed for a short period of time. Also, entomologists were looking at microscopic cricket hairs, which can be found on certain organs attached to the rear of the crickets. They were testing how the hairs react to external environmental stimuli such as velocimetry. They proved that the crickets' hair does, in fact, respond to the environment."},"50":{"1":"185","2":"Scientists who study insects have understood how insects perceive the world around them. In fly vision, special displays present images to individual cells in the fly's brain, and examining their eyes using new techniques shows how a fly perceives images thousands of times faster per second.

With a staggering diversity of over 12,000 identified species, ants exhibit a global presence, adapting to an array of environments and ecosystems.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of ants is their social organization. Each colony functions as a cohesive unit, with distinct roles assigned to various members. The queen, often the largest individual, is the epicenter of reproduction, laying eggs to perpetuate the colony. The majority of the colony comprises worker ants, responsible for tasks such as foraging for food, defending the nest, and caring for the young. Soldiers, equipped with specialized features like powerful mandibles or stingers, serve as the frontline defenders against potential threats.\n\nCommunication within ant colonies is a marvel in itself. Pheromones, chemical signals emitted by ants, form the basis of their intricate communication system. Through these pheromones, ants convey information about the environment, identify colony needs, and warn of potential dangers. This effective communication enables a seamless coordination that allows the colony to adapt swiftly to changes and challenges.\n\nAnts are also renowned for their construction skills.

spanning millions of years, marked by significant anatomical, behavioral, and technological changes. The story begins with Homo habilis, emerging around 2.8 million years ago in East Africa. This species is characterized by increased brain size, primitive tool use, and the ability to walk upright.
