150,archeo,"The study of archaeology and the associated fields of anthropology and paleontology provide valuable insights into the lives of our ancient ancestors, including the Neanderthals. Through the analysis of physical remains, including bones and teeth, scientists can glean information about an individual's sex, age at death, and even details about their health. For example, the dental structure can indicate when a child transitioned from nursing to consuming solid foods, which is critical for understanding childhood development in prehistoric populations.  Furthermore, the examination of anatomical features, such as the size of the nerve controlling respiration, suggests that the capacity for speech and complex communication may not be exclusive to modern humans. The fact that Neanderthals had a similar enlargement in this nerve canal points toward the possibility that they had a level of vocal control and, consequently, some form of language.  Tool analysis further supports this view, indicating that Neanderthals exhibited a preference for right-handedness when crafting their tools. This behavioral trait is often linked to lateralization in the brain, which is associated with language and cognitive processes. The correlation between handedness, tool use, and the potential for language implies that the cognitive capabilities of Neanderthals might have been more advanced than previously thought.  Overall, these findings collectively enhance our understanding of the cognitive and communicative abilities of Neanderthals and suggest a richer and more complex social structure than earlier models proposed.

They use microscopes to examine the eyes and with these techniques they can tell that the fly can see the images in 3 milliseconds.   With crickets entomologists have studied the hairs on a cricket and found that they are the most sensitive organs in the entire animal kingdom   I’m not sure I remember much else,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
137,entom,Entomologists are scientists who study insects. They have specialized in finding out how insects perceive the world. They are interested in how flies visual perception works by using special displays to show images for a very small amount of time like milliseconds. This has shown flies perceive images in less than 3 millionseconds which is around 10 times smaller than a single movie frame.  They also have studied the hair of crickets and have found microscopic hairs on the antenna at the back of the cricket which could be the most sensitive things in the animal kingdom. They used lasers to see how the hairs ract to stimuli. They found these hairs could reacts to very small changes in motion.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

190,entom,"An entomologist is a scientist who studies insects. Some entomologists have recently made discoveries about the abilities of flies and crickets.  Entomologists have been researching and experimenting to gain an understanding of the visual perception of a fly. They have been recording how the brain of the fly reacts when being presented with visual images. They discovered that flies can identify an image when they have looked at it for only three milliseconds. This is a much shorter time frame than a human would need.   Entomologists have also studied crickets. Specifically, the hair on the back of a crickets leg. They have discovered that the hair is more sensitive than any other organ in every animal on earth.

There are specialized entomologists that have uncovered further understanding regarding insects perception of the world around them, and have been able to reveal remarkable abilities. Entomologists have been studying how flies visual perception works, and have used specialized displays to show images for less than the blink of a human eye, utilizing electrodes to record how individual cells in the field's brains might react; as well as ultra precise electron microscopy to inspect their eyes.  Thanks to this research, scientists have shown some flies and insects can perceive images that have been displayed for only three milliseconds - which is a mere thousandth of a second, which can easily be understood as ten times shorter than a typical movie frame, coming in at 24 frames a second.   Entomologists studying specifically the hairs on crickets have shown microscopic hairs, which are found on antenna like organs on the crickets backside are the most sensitive organ in the insect kingdom. The scientists used precision techniques to measure how these hairs reacted to stimuli too, using stimuli like the laser-doppler velocimetry, which is a technique that is capable of detecting the smallest of movements/twitches. Using this showed the researchers that the cricket's hairs reacted to changes in the motion of the air that used less physically charged energy than one particle of light, so less than even a single photon.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
