Archaeology,Entomology
1. Archaeologists can determine whether someone was male or female from their bones.,1. Entomologists use special displays to present images to flies for extremely short periods (less than the blink of an eye).
2. Archaeologists can determine how old someone was from their bones.,2. Entomologists can record how individual cells in flies’ brains react using electrodes.
3. Archaeologists can determine whether someone suffered from a range of diseases from their bones.,3. Entomologists use ultra-precise electron microscopy to examine flies’ eyes.
"4. Archaeologists can determine at what age someone stopped drinking their mother’s milk, based on the composition of their teeth.",4. Some flies can perceive images displayed for just three milliseconds. This duration is about ten times shorter than a single movie frame.
5. The nerve controlling breathing is larger in humans than in apes. The canal containing that nerve is also larger in humans and Neanderthals than in apes.,5. Crickets have microscopic hairs situated on antenna-like organs at their rear. 
6. The fact that the nerve controlling breathing is larger in humans is possibly due to the need for fine-grained control of breathing to speak.,6. Crickets' hairs are possibly the most sensitive organs in the animal kingdom. They react to changes in air motion with less energy than one photon.
"7. Archaeologists determined that most Neanderthals were right-handed, based on analysis of Neanderthals’ tools.","7. Entomologists measured how cricket hairs react to stimuli, using laser-Doppler velocimetry, which can detect extremely minute movements."
8. Handedness is thought to be related to the evolution of language. This suggests that Neanderthals likely possessed a form of language.,
