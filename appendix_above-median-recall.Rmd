# Selection of above-median recall scores in Experiment 2  {#above-median}

\FloatBarrier

Checking recall scores after the main study and before launching the validation study, we found them to be very low on average (see Figure \@ref(fig:distribution-knowledge)). For our hypothesis test, we therefore only kept above median responses, to have a more conservative test for our hypotheses. 

(ref:distribution-knowledge) *Distribution of knowledge score in Experiment 2*.

```{r distribution-knowledge, fig.cap="(ref:distribution-knowledge)"}
median_value <- median(exp2$knowledge_score, na.rm = TRUE)  # Compute median

exp2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = knowledge_score)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Recall score \n (ranging from 0% to 100% retained information)", y = "N Participants") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +  
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median_value), 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 1) +  # Median line
  geom_text(aes(x = median_value + 0.1, y = 20, 
                label = paste0("Median: ", scales::percent(median_value, accuracy = 0.1)
                )
  ),
  inherit.aes = FALSE,
  vjust = -0.5, color = "red") +  # Label for median
